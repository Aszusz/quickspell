# Tauri + React + Typescript

This template should help get you started developing with Tauri, React and Typescript in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)

## Fonts

- We bundle JetBrains Mono (Nerd Font) web cuts only: Regular, Regular Italic, Medium, Medium Italic, SemiBold, SemiBold Italic. Files live in `public/fonts/nerd-font/jetbrains-mono`.
- All heavier assets (TTF/OTF, variable fonts, extra weights) were removed to keep the app footprint small. Add new weights to that folder and extend the `@font-face` entries in `src/index.css` if you need them.
- License for the font is in `public/fonts/nerd-font/jetbrains-mono/OFL.txt`.
